***** Abstract *****
Classification of Cars is Done using Convulational Neural Network to Classify the cars according to the class and model they belong
This technology can help online car sellers/retailer to correctly classify and place their product in perfect inventory for the users
to reach their desired model in lesser time rather than fishing for particular model all over the store.
Some car-models are - 
- Acura Integra Type R 2001
- AM General Hummer SUV 2000
- Ford F-150 Regular Cab 2012
- Hyundai Veloster Hatchback 2012
- Toyota Sequoia SUV 2012
- Volvo C30 Hatchback 2012 etc,.

1. ***** Introduction *****
These Days knowing the sitting capacity and design types people want to see a particular model of a vehicle and as there are so many
non-desirable options according to personal needs people want to look for the particular car type they have in their mind and this project
is made to classify the cars among the well classified models.
This project can be used by Manufacturers to even perticular customers who have a variety of options available in their database.

2. ***** Proposed Work- Diagram/GRaphical Abstract/Layout *****
   2.1. Data Base - Stanford US car Dataset
   2.2. Image Resizing and batch management done while loading

3. ***** Result & Discussion *****
    Graphs attached in github account(link below)

4. ***** Conclusion *****
Looking at the performance of the model this particular problem is more likely to be better solved using feature extraction on the images which
would require Deep Image Processing techniques, in the further working with the model it is likely for me to perform feature extraction.
This is a starting model and on observing other models on Internet(Kaggle's Contributors) we can find these Direct CNN's 
are giving the relatable accuracy as compared to the model made and attached.
